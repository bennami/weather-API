# weather-API

I created a website that forecasts the weather for the next 5 days using the openweathermap.org API

In the begining i got along pretty well with the api, i watched the coding train(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecT42O6I_WI&t=771s) explaining how yo go by the link and that helped a lot. Had i only gone by the documentation of the website, i would have had a lot of trouble.

I was able to retrieve the information from the api quite easily. Then i slowly started realizing that none of the data made sense and that i was hard coding a lot of stuff. 

I had to rewrite a lot of stuff and calculate averages for a bunch of things. One major key was that the api objects update themselves so the first element will always be the current one. I only realised that after a classmate told me so.

I have a lot of repetitive code and I tried not to use bootstrap for my css. If i had more time i would have used SASS and implemented the css grid to make it responsive.

Link to actual website is not working atm..:
