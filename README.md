# weather-API

I created a website that forecasts the weather for the next 5 days using the openweathermap.or api

In the begining i got along pretty well with the api, i watched the coding train explaining how yo go by the link and that helped a lot. Had i only gone by the documentation of the website, i would have had a lot of trouble.

I was able to retrieve the information from the api quite easily. Then i slowly started realizing that none of the data made sense and that i was hard coding a lot of stuff. 

I had to rewrite a lot of stuff and calculate averages for a bunch of things. One major key was that the api objects update themselves so the first element will always be the current one. 

Link to actual website is not working atm:
